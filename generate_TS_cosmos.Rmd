This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Case1:
## You wish to generate 3 time series of size 1000 each
## that follow the Generalized Gamma distribution with parameters
## scale = 1, shape1 = 0.8, shape2 = 0.8
## and autocorrelation structure the ParetoII
## with parameters scale = 1 and shape = .75
x <- generateTS(margdist = 'ggamma',
margarg = list(scale = 1,
shape1 = .8,
shape2 = .8),
acsvalue = acs(id = 'paretoII',
t = 0:30,
scale = 1,
shape = .75),
n = 1000,
p = 30,
TSn = 3)
## see the results
plot(x)

## Case2:
## You wish to generate time series the same distribution
## and autocorrelations as is Case1 but intermittent
## with probability zero equal to 90%
y <- generateTS(margdist = 'ggamma',
margarg = list(scale = 1,
shape1 = .8,
shape2 = .8),
acsvalue = acs(id = 'paretoII',
t = 0:30,
scale = 1,
shape = .75),
p0 = .9,
n = 1000,
p = 30,
TSn = 3)
## see the results
plot(y)

## Case3:
## You wish to generate a time series of size 1000
## that follows the Beta distribution
## (e.g., relative humidity ranging from 0 to 1)
## with parameters shape1 = 0.8, shape2 = 0.8, is defined from 0 to 1
## and autocorrelation structure the ParetoII
## with parameters scale = 1 and shape = .75
z <- generateTS(margdist = 'beta',
margarg = list(shape1 = .6,
shape2 = .8),
distbounds = c(0, 1),
acsvalue = acs(id = 'paretoII',
t = 0:30,
scale = 1,
shape = .75),
n = 1000,
p = 20)
## see the results
plot(z)

## Case4:
## Same in previous case but now you provide specific
## autocorrelation values for the first three lags,
## ie.., lag 1 to 3 equal to 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7
z <- generateTS(margdist = 'beta',
margarg = list(shape1 = .6,
shape2 = .8),
distbounds = c(0, 1),
acsvalue = c(1, .9, .8, .7),
n = 1000,
p = TRUE)
## see the results
plot(z)
